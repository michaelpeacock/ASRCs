# ASRCs

We will use a device to collect environmental data (kestrel weather meter or rasperry pi). We will implement a way to import the collected data into Excel. Once it's there we will create an add on to allow for us to check whether or not we are recieving normal or abnormal data. We will build graphs and tables with the data collected. We will be able to serialize the data so that it can be opened in other C# applications. Our application will allow us to make data portable to other C# programs or other excel desktops.
